# File Organiser

## Description

This is my version of a file organiser in Golang. This program was designed to help users automatically organize their `Downloads` folder into specific subfolders based on their file types. This idea was initiated to help keep your `Downloads` folder clean and organised, making it easier to find files and reduce the level of clutter.

## How to Use

Ensure that you have `go` installed on your machine so as to enable you run the program. Clone the `File Organiser` repo from the github URL [https://github.com/Manuelshub/File_Organiser/tree/main](https://github.com/Manuelshub/File_Organiser/tree/main). Open up the repo and run the program with the go run main.go command.

## Prerequisities

go version go1.21.x or later

## Folder Structure

This File Organiser program creates the following subfolders within your `~Downloads` folder:

**Images:** This folder will contain all image files with the extensions .jpg, .png and .jpeg

**Videos:** This folder will contain all video files with the extensions .mov, .mp4, and .avi.

**Music:** This folder will contain all video files with the extensions .mp3, .wav, .flac

**Documents:** This folder will contain all music document files with the extensions .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .pptx, .xlsx

## Note

This program will only move files that are not already in their respective destination sub-folder. If a file with the same name already exists in one of the folders, the program will skip moving that particular file.
